I chose to make a quiz which determines to which country the 
user would like to travel after corona situation is over. :)
I defined the possible choices to each question in a different list, 
in arranged order by country (Japan, USA, The Netherlands or England).
I used keyInSelect() to present each question and its available answers for the user to choose.
To avoid the chance that the user will be able to guess
the way the points are calculated, I decided to use the .shuffle() method from the
underscore library to make a copy of each choices list, so the answers to each question 
will be logged in random order.
I set 4 variables, one for each country you could get as a result.
To calculate the user's result, I defined a function, incrementCountryPoints,
in which I use to check the user's answer to each question in the following way: 
matching it to the same answer in the original arranged choices array, 
and then incrementing the matching country total points depends on the user's answer.

At the end, I use Math.max() to check which country got the highest amount of points, and log the result
to the user accordingly. Of course there is a chance for 2 or 3 countries with the same amount of points. In this case,
only one of them will be logged (Since in those kind of quizes we only get 1 answer).
